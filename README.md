# Some Install Scripts

The repo contains a few scripts to install a package from source.
They worked for me but I cannot guarantee that they will work for you.
**Use at your own risk!**

Every script installs the specified package into `$HOME/local`.

## Scripts

<ul>
    <li> Ubuntu 22.04
    <ul>
        <li> OpenSSL 3.1.4
        <li> Python 3.11.6
        <li> Sqlite 3.44.2
    </ul>
</ul>
